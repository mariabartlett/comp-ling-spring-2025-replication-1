The authors' complete replication materials (data, code, output) is available for download here (33 files in total):

https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/9SF3TI

Although the authors' replication package includes 33 files, only four are required to replicate our code:

1. `CF_output_f952737.csv` (Crowdflower results file 1)
2. `CF_output_f999866.csv` (Crowdflower results file 2)
3. `BT_unstructured_brT_abilities.rda` (Unstructured Bradley-Terry model results (with bias reduction))
4. `BT_unstructured_brF_abilities.rda` (Unstructured Bradley-Terry model results (no bias reduction))

We also recommend downloading `Codebook.pdf` to understand variables included in the replication files and `README.pdf` to understand the overall structure and contents of the authors' replication package.
